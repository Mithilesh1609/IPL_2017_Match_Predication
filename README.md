# IPL_2017_Match_Predication

This is **python** implementation of predicting our favorite cricket league **IPL** using **Random forest** and **logistic regression classifier**.

## Source of the Dataset
We have used dataset from kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)) which is contrubuted by Manas.

## python library used
- **Pandas** (for data processing and I/O operation of CSV file)([reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-data-analysis-using-pandas/))
- **Numpy**  (for basic linear algebra) ([reference](https://numpy.org/))
- **Sklearn** (for building predictive model) ([reference](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning))
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting the data) ([reference](https://matplotlib.org/))
- **Seaborn** (for statistical data visualization)([reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-graph-using-seaborn-python/))
- **Sklearn.kFlod** (for split the testing and traning data)([reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-test-split-and-cross-validation-in-python-80b61beca4b6))

## Results
- First I used basic **logistic regression model** which is getting very low accuracy of **24.01%**
- And then I used **Random forest classification** model which is giving great accuracy of **89.15%**
