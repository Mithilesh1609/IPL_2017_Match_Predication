# IPL_2017_Match_Predication

This is **python** implementation of predicting our favorite cricket league **IPL** using **Random forest** and **logistic regression classifier**.

## Source of the Dataset
We have used dataset from kaggle ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl)) which is contrubuted by Manas.

## python library used
- **Pandas** (for data processing and I/O operation of CSV file)
- **Numpy**  (for basic linear algebra)
- **Sklearn** (for building predictive model)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting the data)
- **Seaborn** (for statistical data visualization)
- **sklearn.Kflod** (for split the testing and traning data)

## Results
- First I used basic **logistic regression model** which is getting very low accuracy of **24.01%**
- And then I used **Random forest classification** model which is giving great accuracy of **89.15%**
